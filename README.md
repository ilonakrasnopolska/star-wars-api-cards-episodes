# Star Wars API Cards Episodes

This project is a simple application that displays Star Wars episodes as cards, fetched from an external API. Upon clicking on an episode card, the app shows detailed information about that episode, including its description, associated planets, and characters. The application features lazy loading, async/await for API calls, and custom styling.

## Features

- **Episode Cards**: Display a list of cards for each Star Wars episode, showing brief information about each.
- **Episode Details**: When clicking on an episode card, detailed information is displayed, including the episode description, planets, and characters.
- **Navigation**: Smooth and easy navigation to view more details and return to the main list of episodes.
- **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: Data is fetched asynchronously using `async/await` and Promises to ensure efficient loading.
- **Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded lazily, improving the performance of the app by only loading the necessary content when required.
- **Custom Styling**: The UI is fully styled from scratch to give the app a unique and user-friendly appearance.

## Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Used for core logic, async data fetching, and handling user interaction.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for the app, ensuring it looks clean and organized.
- **Async/Await**: For handling asynchronous data requests and improving the overall user experience.
- **Promises**: Used for managing API responses and data flow.
